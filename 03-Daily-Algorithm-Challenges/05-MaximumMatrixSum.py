# 1975. Maximum Matrix Sum (5th Of January 2026)

# You are given an n x n integer matrix. You can do the following operation any number of times:
# Choose any two adjacent elements of matrix and multiply each of them by -1.
# Two elements are considered adjacent if and only if they share a border.
# Your goal is to maximize the summation of the matrix's elements. Return the maximum sum of the matrix's elements using the operation mentioned above.

# Example 1:

# Input: matrix = [[1,-1],[-1,1]]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: We can follow the following steps to reach sum equals 4:
# - Multiply the 2 elements in the first row by -1.
# - Multiply the 2 elements in the first column by -1.
